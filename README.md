# UpdateFaker

Update Faker allows you to "fake a system update", it's the perfect way to prank your friends, family members or colleagues. Especially when they're working on something rather important. 

While they are away from their PC, navigate to [updatefaker.com](https://updatefaker.com/) and click on one of the appropriate themes. Once they arrive back at their computer, they will almost certainly start to freak out.

You decide how long you want to let them suffer in frustration before telling them it's just a prank website.

## About
The idea behind Update Faker originated almost a decade ago in an obscure Steam group chat. "Wouldn't it be funny if you could fake system updates?" That's basically all it took for this idea to take off. Still, it took quite some time (several years) before the website would actually go live. A huge thank you to Vlovsky for providing us with the code for the various fake system update screens.

Ever since the launch of updatefaker.com, we've been flooded with positive feedback both online and in real life. And everyone who's ever fallen victim to update faker will never leave their PC unattended again, which certainly is a good thing. You never know what bad things people are up to. This website is literally one of the least bad things that can happen to an unattended PC. 

TIP: **Lock your PC people**. All it takes is WINDOWS KEY + L (Microsoft Windows) or CONTROL + SHIFT + POWER (Mac OS X).

## Suggestions
Ideas including, but not limited to, "fake system update screens" are always welcome. How do you get these to us? Simply use the hashtag #updatefaker on Twitter. It'll reach us eventually. You can also send our Facebook page a private message if that's your thing. You will always get credited; that's a promise.

We'd like to thank Boman34 for coming up with the ideas to also include older systems like Microsoft Windows 98 and Microsoft Windows XP. Both "fake update screens" have since then been added and have confused a fair share of people!
